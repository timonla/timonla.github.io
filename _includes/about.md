## About my work

### Lean Marine

Since spring 2020 I am working as a fullstack developer for [Lean Marine]("https://leanmarine.com/").

At Lean Marine I get to work with an excellent group of people who are just as excited about saving the environment as I am.
We use the latest technologies to implement solutions for the shipping industry.
Our tools assist in improving efficiency in operational planning and voyage execution and help ship-owners to reduce costs and fuel consumption.

[Fleet Analytics]("https://leanmarine.com/fleet-analytics/"):
I primarily work with the development of Fleet Analytics, which is our cloud-based reporting and data analysis solution.
It handles all the data generated by the vessels in operation and helps to evaluate and improve their performance.

My work includes contributing to all parts of our code base.
This means mainly kotlin and postgres for the backend and I am very excited to also have been taking my frontend experience into a professional context.
Here I am developing with React, TypeScript and Redux.

### Flashkill App

In April 2019 my brother and I launched the MVP to our latest side project.
We are developing a browser extension for [99Damage]("https://csgo.99damage.de/de/start") which is the biggest german platform for Counter Strike leagues.
Driven by our own frustation with their website we decided to automate site requests to improve the user experience.
Trying to disturb the user as little as possible we are integrating additional information such as team statistics directly on the website.
Since our first release we have already implemented a number of features that are saving our growing user base hours upon hours.
In spring 2020 the daily user numbers peeked at more than <b>2300 users</b>.
The extension can be installed for both [Chrome]("https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/haodokcagfamodepjecmfemicdkdcekk/publish-accepted?authuser=1&hl=en")
and [Firefox]("https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashkill/").

### Volvo Group

From fall 2018 to spring 2020 I was working as an application developer for the Volvo Group.

#### ServiceNow Development:
My last delivery was part of the function Quality & Runtime Practices which is driving and supporting quality across Group IT.
In this role I was working with enabling Volvo to make use of the
[Performance Analytics]("https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/performance-analytics/reference/r_PALandingPage.html?cshalt=yes")
engine built into the ITSM tool [ServiceNow]("link" target="_blank" href="https://www.servicenow.com/").
My work included understanding the business needs, researching new technologies and proposing and implementing solutions to make use of our data.
I also worked on defining best practices to for the use of the Business Inteligence & Analytics solutions of ServiceNow.

As part of this work I earned hands on knowledge about how to work with the ITIL processes, mainly incident, problem and change management.
In the fall of 2019 I got certified for [ITIL 4 Foundation]("https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-certifications/itil-foundation").

#### Graduate Program:
In my first year at Volvo I took part in the Volvo Group's first IT graduate program.
In addition to our regular assignments we worked in projects around Volvo's strategic IT priorities and had workshop weeks in India, France and Sweden.
My project dealt with leveraging Volvo's data assets to enable Advanced Analytics.
During the workshop weeks we gained holistic knowledge about the Volvo Group and took part in personal development workshops.

#### .NET Development:
In my first assignment I developed Azure chatbots using the [Microsoft Bot Framework]("https://dev.botframework.com/").
My work included researching available technologies and finding parts of the implementation that can be generalized to allow for a higher reusability of our code.
In POCs we demonstrated how to develop chatbots with data-driven dialog structures that can be used as templates to solve similar use-cases.

## About me

I moved to Gothenburg, Sweden in the fall of 2016 to attend a MSc. program in computer science at Chalmers.
Find out more about my studies in my resume.

When I am not working with computer science, I am likely exploring the beautiful nature around Gothenburg
and probably have my bike with me.
It has been my main means of transportation for several years now.
However, only my daily commutes of 42km made me push my boundaries in terms of what distances are management by bike.
In 2019 I had my first 100km+ ride and just a few months later decided to travel *969km* to my hometown Berlin entirely by bike.
Since then I am hooked on the idea of bikepacking. From time to time I try to share some of my bike adventures on [Instagram]("https://www.instagram.com/timon.ruotsalainen/").

My biggest passion is change.
No matter, if it comes to refactoring source code, improving my diet or finding the most eco friendly way to travel to Berlin.
I am never done looking for opportunities to improve and am quick to challenge current solutions.
With an open mind and creative thinking I develop solutions and aim for simplicity.
My technical background and work experience allow me to use modern technologies and automation to achieve exactly that.
Today, I am most excited about finding ways to improve environmental and social sustainability.

Among my other interests are minimalism, biohacking, writing music which I upload to my [YouTube]("https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp5zwA-JgwGzmgHOeeP1h4g?view_as=subscriber") channel from time to time and cooking.
