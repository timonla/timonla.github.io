My name is Timon and I am a computer scientist and avid cyclist from Berlin.

My biggest passion is change.
No matter if it's regarding technology, my diet or finding the most eco-friendly way to travel home to Berlin.
I am never done looking for opportunities to improve and am quick to challenge current solutions.
With an open mind and creative thinking I develop solutions and aim for simplicity.
