Recently I finally set out to find a fueling solution for my bike adventures
that aligns with my environmental, health and economic sustainability ideals.
This involved getting a much better understanding on what my body actually needs
than just buying whatever of the shelf product.

# Fueling on the bike

For the past few years I have continuously increased the amount of time I
spend on bike adventures.
Such adventures can look very differently.
I could be on a commute through the city, on a long weekend ride or even on a
multi-day bikepacking trip through multiple countries.

As soon as these adventures became longer than an hour, I realized that
they are much easier to manage if I am paying attention to fueling my body 
correctly and that my training progress would be much better as well.

While we are able to tell quite quickly when we are running out of fluids,
it is much more difficult to tell at what point we need to start eating, if
you never looked into the issue.
Most likely you will just realize that you should probably eat something,
when you have already [bonked](https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/what-is-bonking-causes-dangers-and-prevention/).

# Packaging

# Bottle mix

I follow a mostly WFPB diet and try to stick to that as much as possible.
Last year I wrote an entire [blog post](/blog/diet-review-2020/) about what that
means to me.
However, in extreme situations such as all day bike rides, it is difficult to 
consume all the necessary carbohydrates in whole foods.
There are only so many bananas that you can put into your jersey pockets and there
is a limit to how many bananas are fun to eat as well.

When doing intense multi-hour efforts, your body simply consumes a lot of sugar
so I will fill my bottles with some extra sugar and also add some electrolyte 
powder.

In creating my own bottle mixture, I am able to tweak the amount of sugar to
my exact need and am able to save a lot of packaging and cost.

# Energy bars

I wanted these to be healthy, easy to prepare, easy to carry in the jersey
pockets and easy to eat while riding.
So basically have all the properties like store-bought bars but without
the packaging and with more fine tuned ingedrients.

## Recipe

Not really a stable recipe, since I eyeball these most of the time.
They are really difficult to fuck up, if you add the water little by little.

At this instance they ended up containing:
* 150g Oats
* 182g Bananas
* 58g Peanut butter
* 21g Maple syrup
* 65g Dates
* 1ml Vanilla powder
* 3ml Cinnamon
* 60ml Water

But you can add other dried fruits, seeds, kokoa powder, other nut butters, ...

I just smash it all with a fork and blend it, adding water so that it all
sticks together nicely.
I usually don't mix it up too well which will result in different bites having
a slightly different taste.
That effect is much appreciated if you are eating your 6th bar of the ride.
However, you could also just prepare two different kinds of bars or sprinkle
some extra ingredient on top of half of the mixture. ðŸ¤·

Then I just spread the mixture in an oven dish in the rough shape that the
bars shall have in the end.

I set the oven to 180 Â°C and put the dish in for 30 minutes already when the oven
is getting up to heat.
My oven is pretty crappy, so maybe start with 20 minutes and give them a bit longer
if needed?

Afterwards I let the bars cool a bit, cut them into pieces, package them and
put them into the fridge to be consumed over the next two days.
I have not tried freezing them yet and I think the IKEA bags are also not meant
to be frozen but you could probably prepare a huge load, freeze them in some
tupper ware and then package them whenever you need them.

These kind of bars work for me and my diet.
GCN showed how to prepare some classic rice cakes and date balls some time ago.

## Eating

I am really not the best bike handler so the fact that I can eat these so easily
on the bike means that probably you can too. ðŸ˜‰
