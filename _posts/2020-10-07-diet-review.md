My diet is a very important topic for me and as such I am willing to experiment a lot with it and throw everything,
I thought I knew, overboard, if I learn something new.
From time to time I like to review my diet on whatever factors I recently altered.

So I tracked and analyzed it in great detail over one week.
Unless you are an Olympic athlete and want to get the highest possible performance and recovery from
your body or have a serious medical condition, I don't think there is a point in doing this all the time.
However, doing it when trying out new stuff, can give you a good understanding what foods contain
which nutrients and you can use that on a day to day basis without thinking much about it.

#### What is new, what have I changed recently?

The main subjects under review for this week are affordability and the amount of processed/packaged foods that I consume.
I recently started cutting down on packaged foods such as Oat drinks, pre-cooked beans and tofu,
in an attempt to reduce cost, waste and nutrition.
As I was quite happy with the diet in the past month I am simply interested in what amount of money I have to spend on,
what I consider, a healthy and tasty diet, without growing my own vegetables or having to compromise on non-organic food.

While I am at it I will analyze the nutrients, since I have not done this in a while.

#### About this post

The idea of making this review public is to share my day to day experience with my diet in great detail, as I receive questions on
inspiration on a regular basis and feel that most *What I eat in a day* content on social media only shows the glorious parts or
is simply not detailed enough.

I will not put any additional effort or research into what I am eating during this week.
This, I hope, will give you an idea and some inspiration, what is achievable with very little effort.
I will not use any special kitchen utensils, the most exotic thing, being a blender, to make the results reproducible
for virtually anyone.
I will not provide vague cooking instructions and some insights in why I choose certain ingredients.

I usually don't care too much about how my food looks.
For the sake of promoting this diet however, I put slightly more effort into trying to make it look appealing.

#### What labels do I assign my diet?

This list is by no means *final* but at the time of writing this:
* My diet is plant based
* I try to eat as many *whole foods*/*unprocessed foods* as possible
* I avoid gluten if possible
* I don't consume alcohol (apart from my vitamin B12 drops)
* I avoid caffeine
* I avoid salt if possible
* I avoid oil
* I try to not eat too much fat

If you are interested in some more inspiration on similar diets I can highly recommend:
* Dr. Greger's Book [HOW NOT TO DIE](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/) as well as
[NutritionalFacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) in general
* Simnett Nutrition's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpyhJZhJQWKDdJCR07jPY-Q)
* Mic the Vegan's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJq0eQZoFSwgcqgxIE9MHw)
* The Vegan Corner [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/thevegancorner)

### Review process

For every day, I will log:
* Time of waking up
* Time of going to bed
* Starting time of every food preparation
* Starting time of every meal
* Photo of every meal
* Some more notes on the food choices
* Amount of every ingredient used (spices only as week total)
* Price per 100g in Euro and SEK of every ingredient in Gothenburg/Sweden

I am using [this scale](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B017NZNKYW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
which is not super accurate when it comes to single gram differences.
So I will weigh my spice glasses once at the start of the week and once at the end,
to get a weekly estimation of the price.
I will NOT log the grams of spices per meal in cronometer.
I will have to weigh a lot of foods twice, as, for a banana for example, I want to track the calories of the part that ate,
but the price of the banana including its peel.
Once the week is over I will track everything, as good as possible, in cronometer, to analyze calories,
macro and micro nutrients.

## Disclaimer

As of writing this, I am working in the home office.
So there won't be as much meal prep going on, as it might have been half a year ago.
However, considering the situation in the world right now, it's probably not as relevant as it used to be either.

I usually exercise quite a lot and burn between 3000 and 4000 kcal a day.
The portion sizes will seem unreasonable at times, but I know what I am about.
One of the great advantages I see, in following a whole food plant based diet, is, that it is really difficult
to overeat, since you will simply be full.

I am not a great cook and don't have a lot of recipes to share.
I usually think of all the ingredients I would like to eat and then assemble a random dish using them.
For that I try to understand, through a lot of experiments, how certain ingredients will behave while cooking
and how to use that to my advantage.
To get started, [the vegan corner YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/thevegancorner) is an excellent
starting point.
They are excellent chefs and share a lot of really detailed recipes.
While doing so they let you know their secrets on how to utilize certain ingredient properties
for breathtaking vegan and mostly whole food meals.

My approach has worked fine for me in the past years.
I always like my food, since when it's prepared with only delicious ingredients, why shouldn't the end result 
be delicious as well? :)

I am neither a medical or nutritional expert.
What I document here is simply my experience and the decisions I make for me personally.
Please take this as an inspiration and consult someone qualified before undertaking drastic diet changes.

## Logbook

### Supplements

In the morning with the first glass of water I consume a few supplements.

##### Vitamin B12

You will find a lot of plant and animal products fortified with B12.
However, Vitamin B12 is very important and especially since I am cutting out most processed foods
I don't take any risks here.
I'd recommend anyone, no matter if on a vegetarian or vegan diet or not, to supplement this.
Your body will absorb as much as it needs and get rid of the rest through the urine.

I am using these [Vitamin B12 drops](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07K1D8M1N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
I take 5 drops per day, providing me with 1000mcg of Vitamin B12.
One bottle contains 1700 drops and lasts for 340 days.
The drops that I currently use still have an alcohol base, unlike the ones listed on amazon at the time of writing this.
Vitamin B12 is not very expensive.
When choosing your supplement, I'd suggest to go for the bio active forms **Methylcobalamin** or **Adenosylcobalamin**.

Price: **0.07 EUR/0.70 SEK** per day.

##### Vitamin D3+K2

Living in Sweden it's pretty much impossible to consistently get my
Vitamin D3 dose any time of the year.
So I take Vitamin D3 drops year round with Vitamin K2 mainly to boost 
the D3 absorption.

I am using these [Vitamin D3+K2 drops](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07BK9F7WB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
I take 5 per day providing me with 125mcg of Vitamin D3 and 100mcg of Vitamin K2.
One bottle contains 1700 drops and lasts for 340 days.

Price: **0.06 EUR/0.67 SEK** per day.

##### Iodine

I have tried putting dulse in my smoothies before but find that a tea spoon of dulse is capable
of altering the taste of a 1 liter smoothie quite drastically.
I did this for over a year and got used to it but still prefer my smoothies without it.
Capsules are much more convenient.

I am using these [Iodine capsules](https://www.apotea.se/helhetshalsa-eko-jod-100-kapslar).
I take one capsule per day, providing me with 150mcg of Iodine.
One tub contains 100 capsules and will last for 100 days.

Price: **0.15 EUR/1.55 SEK** per day.

### Spices

I forgot to measure salt.
During the week I just used a pinch of salt in two dishes respectively and since salt is rather cheap
I think it's not too big of a deal.

#### 7:30 Coconut Oil

I got up at 7:30.
The first thing, when I get out of bed, is to clean my tongue and pull some coconut
oil through my teeth before brushing them.
I spit the oil out and in that sense it serves more hygienic purpose
but since it counts as food and I am tracking all kinds of stuff anyways, I added it.

#### 7:50 Lemon water

![Lemon Water](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/monday-lemon.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

The first thing I usually have in the morning is some lemon water.
Sometimes I just drink the lemon juice with water, sometimes I mix it with some herbal infusion.
This is also the time I take my supplements, so I don't forget them.
I won't drink the entire liter at once, this usually lasts a few hours.

#### 9:40 Breakfast

![Breakfast](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/monday-breakfast.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

#### Oat meal

My go-to breakfast at the moment is oat meal.
I have experimented with numerous other carbohydrate bases in my breakfast over the years,
rice flakes, rice dosas, spelt flakes, corn flakes, cooked buckwheat, sprouted buckwheat, buckwheat tortillas,
cooked oats, overnight oats, ...
For a while now I am settled on oats.
They are the easiest to use, taste amazing and I am able to digest them well.

I add flax seeds, which are my primary source of Omega-3 fatty acids.
I ground the seeds right before I add them to the bowl.
Frozen blueberries (preferably the smaller wild ones instead of the big cultivated ones) are
easy to get here and my favorite berry.
I usually only swap them out with other berries if they are sold out at the store.
Berries are one of Dr. Greger's [daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen-challenge/)
and a great source of antioxidants.
I add banana or frozen mango, mainly for taste and extra calories.

I recently came off my Oatly chocolate drink addiction, which I used to always have in my oat meal.
Since then I experimented with hemp seeds, almond flour and coconut flakes combinations with cocoa
powder and water to replace it.
I am able to cut out more of week by week, as my taste buds slowly forget the processed aroma glory 
of the chocolate drink.

Last but not least a sprinkle of cinnamon (Ceylon) and some other source of nuts goes on top.
Usually peanut butter, almond butter or walnuts, with peanut butter being the go-to right now.

I usually don't measure any of this and just add however much I feel like.
But I have measured all of these before and as the week will show I am able to quite precisely
scoop out 30g of any nut butter out of a jar.

#### Washing the sprouts

In the morning and evening I have to rinse the sprouts that I am constantly growing.

Sprouting legumes and other seeds is a great way to get something fresh into your diet without
having to invest in, in my option, pointless iceberg lettuce or something similar.
It takes a bit of planning, as you will need to know a few days in advance, what you want to eat.
However, if you end up not eating them, they can be stored in the fridge for a few days and stop
growing.
On Sunday evening I soaked 30g of green lentils, 30g of sweet lupines, 20g of chickpeas
(all dry weights).
They will all take about 3 days, until they are at my preferred growth state.
Since the experiment I switched to soaking the legumes during the day.
This gives them 12 more hours before I eat them.
How long sprouts will take to grow to a certain state, depends a lot on the temperature
in your kitchen.

If you are interested in sprouting your own legumes, it's super easy to get started.
All you need is a colander for straining and a bowl to let them grow in.
I cannot emphasize enough how much of a waste of money it is to buy sprouting kits!
Just buy mason jars and the lids.
Even if you later decide sprouting is not for you, they can be of great use in the kitchen.

They make life a bit easier and are definitely worth the investment
if you are doing this regularly.

I use [these lids](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07B3Q336D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
and [these glasses](https://www.bormiolirocco.com/en/product/700/jar-50-3-4-oz-quattro-stagioni) in 1l and 1.5l sizes.

Most legumes should be soaked for 12 hours and then they need to be washed at least twice a day.
Just drain them well with the colander and then put them in a bowl for the rest of the day.

#### 13:28 Snack

![Snack while preparing lunch](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/monday-snack.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

I started preparing lunch and needed to eat something in between.
I like to snack on dried fruits and nuts.

#### 13:50 Lunch

![Monday lunch](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/monday-lunch.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Even while working from home I usually cook one meal that I can have for lunch three days in a row to save some time in the kitchen.
This week this meal is a rice dish (eating lots of rice is a recurring theme in my diet 🌝), with some vegetables in a coconut milk sauce.
In the disclaimer I mentioned that I am a basic cook and this dish is the best example for it.
Start by getting the rice to a boil and in the meantime throw all the other ingredients
(except for the starch) into another pot, and cook until the lentils are soft.
As spices I added: turmeric, coriander, ginger, chili, smoked paprika and cinnamon.

Some usually buy a lot of my vegetables frozen as I often find myself quite disappointed with
how Swedish supermarkets tend to store their organic vegetables.
They lie in lots of plastic bags in the fridge and if you look closely they are already moldy.
It's for example almost impossible to find good organic mushrooms.
On top of that they are more expensive...

Once the lentils are ready, I wait for the the dish to cool down a slight bit,
mix the starch with a sip of water and then add it to the pot while stirring.
This will thicken the sauce a bit (or a lot, if you add too much starch).
It's important to not add it into a boiling liquid or it will harden immediately and you will
obtain a lumpy sauce.

I topped the portion that I ate directly off with some sesame seeds and nutritional yeast and
will likely do the same when I take the other portions out of the fridge.

The portions are not exactly equally large which is due to that I'd rather prepare a bit too much
sauce than too little, because dry food is the work of the devil.
Everything that does not fit into the lunch boxes has to be eaten on the same day.

#### 20:17 Soaking some beans

![Corn cakes](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/monday-evening-snack.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Snacking on some corn cakes, while doing the dishes and soaking some legumes and sunflower seeds.

#### Corn cakes

Rice and corn cakes fulfill two purposes in my kitchen.
Firstly, they are a great, quick and gluten free alternative to bread.

A few go-to toppings are:

* Peanut butter, cinnamon and bananas or dates
* Peanut butter, pickles and mustard (yes, I am serious)
* Bean spread, onions and pickles
* Some condiment, tofu, onions, pickles

... I really like pickles but I also use sauerkraut of kimchi some times.

Apart from that, rice and corn cakes are a nice, be it more bland, chips like snack which you
can even take with you if you are going for a long walk.
You can be sure that I will have a pack of them in my backpack any time I go out and am uncertain
how long it is to the next meal or if the food will be good. (Just make sure that you have enough
water with you 🌵)

#### Soaking beans

I simply wash the legumes and seeds well in the glass before filling the entire container with water
and leaving it to soak for 12 hours.
Soaking times depend on what you want to sprout, but 12 hours is long enough for most seeds.
In the galas there are 41g of green lentils, 40g of sweet lupines, 21g of red lentils
and 20g of sunflower seeds (all dry weights).

#### 7:13 Coconut Oil

#### 7:40 Lemon Juice

![Lemon water](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-lemon.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Lemon water same as on Monday 🌝.
I also rinsed the legumes I soaked on Monday and Sunday evening.

#### 10:27 Breakfast

![Breakfast](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-breakfast.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Same as yesterday, slightly less oats because slightly less hungry.
I only put the coconut flakes on top because I expected it looks more appealing in the photo.
Be the judge of how that turned out.

#### 12:37 Lunch

![Lunch](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-lunch.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

I got my lunch out of the fridge and sprinkled some nutritional yeast and sesame seeds on top.
Most times I don't bother to get it out of the lunch box and heat it up.
I just wait a bit and start eating.

#### 15:30 Isotonic drink

![Isotonic drink](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-iso.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

When riding the bike for more than an hour I will usually drink some isotonic drink.
Especially when riding indoors, as I am doing a lot this time of the year, I sweat a lot
and am loosing a lot of minerals.
Also on longer rides it's an easy way to continuously consume some sugars.

#### 17:18 Dinner preparations

![Potato Soup](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-dinner-total.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

I craved some soup.
So I cut everything into small pieces, put it into the pot and boiled it until the potatoes
had the desired softness.
The beet root will be still a bit crunchy.
Eating too raw beet root is not for the light-hearted so make sure that you taste some of it before 
turning off the stove.
As spices I added basil, ginger, turmeric some vegetable broth and smoked paprika.
Because I did not want to cook the tomatoes forever I added some bicarbonate,
to take away some of the sourness.

If I am putting seeds on top of a meal I often go the extra step to slightly roast them.
Works great with for example pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts.

Here I roasted some pumpkin seeds and sprinkled them on top with some nutritional yeast.

I got impatient and ate a few corn cakes. 🌝

![Corn Cakes](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-snack.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

#### Precook your beans

![Frozen Beans](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-frozen-beans.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

If you don't want to buy pre-cooked beans but don't plan every meal in advance,
I find it useful to just boil a whole pack of beans, drain them well ant put them in the freezer.
Then you can just sprinkle them in whatever meal while it's on the stove.

#### 18:10, 18:50, 19:53 & 20:27 Dinner

![Dinner one portion](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/tuesday-dinner-single.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

I don't have this big a dish so I split it up in 4 portions like this, that I will eat during the evening.
This meal was a bit too much.
The last bowl felt a bit forced.
Three portions would have been ideal.

#### 7:28 Coconut Oil

#### 7:55 Lemon water

![Lemon water](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/wednesday-lemon.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Today with peppermint tea.
Also washed the sprouts.

#### 9:50 Breakfast

![Oat meal](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/wednesday-breakfast.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Not really different from the other days, except that I added some frozen mango instead of a part of the berries and banana.

#### 13:58 Lunch

![Lunch](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/wednesday-lunch.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Same as the day before, only that I put cashews on top instead of sesame seeds.

#### 15:55 - 17:00 Took a nap

#### 17:55 Smoothie

![Smoothie](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/wednesday-smoothie.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Well, making a smoothie is not exactly science.
Put all the stuff in the blender and blend. 🌝
With so much frozen stuff, it's important to put the unfrozen stuff at the bottom and choose the right water temperature.

In recent years I have cut down on the amount of bananas I eat.
These days I mainly eat them in my oat meal, on bike rides or in smoothies.
I still think it's good practice to always have a large amount of bananas at your disposal.
You will be able to eat them when they are at their sweetest and if they at some point get too ripe,
you can just freeze them in smaller pieces.
Frozen bananas are excellent for smoothies or nice cream.
Also you can ensure to always have a *banana for size* at hand, if you take a photo of a big spider or something.

![Frozen banana](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/wednesday-frozen-banana.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

#### 20:38 Eating and soaking sprouts

![Sprouts](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/wednesday-sprouts.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

After I rinse the sprouts, I just put them in a bowl, sprinkle a sip of tamari on top
and then put on some nutritional yeast and spices.
Today I used some PiriPiri, I also did not really track the price of that.
I bought it in India some time ago.

#### Soaking new sprouts

![](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/wednesday-soaking.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Soaked 50g of green lentils and 50g of sweet lupines (all dry weights).

#### 21:38 Corn Cakes

Also washed the sprouts.

#### 10:34 Breakfast

![Breakfast](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/thursday-breakfast.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

#### 15:33 Lunch

![Lunch](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/thursday-lunch.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

This is one of my favorite dishes right now.
I just cook the leek and cabbage in a bit of water with the spices and add the miso paste in the end.
As spices I added chili, coriander and ginger.

In a separate pot I will cook the noodles.
Lately I switched to whole grain rice pasta instead of your standard white rice vermicelli
or udon noodles that you might use for this.
I can buy these organic and they have much more flavor.

The rest of the ingredients goes onto a baking tray, which I layout with a silicon sheet
and is sprinkled with some tamari and sesame seeds.
I set the oven to 180°C for like half an hour and turn the stuff around half way.

![Oven pre-cooked](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/thursday-lunch-pre.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

![Oven post cooked](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/thursday-lunch-post.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

After that I assemble the dish.
Notice that I cooked the vegetables, tofu and broth for the next day as well. 🧠
Lastly assemble the dish, put some nutritional yeast on top and fill it up with boiling water.
The dish is unfortunately a bit too small for 300g of pasta.
Check out the photos on Friday, where I split the portion onto two dishes.

#### 20:55 Sprouts

![Sprouts](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/thursday-sprouts.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Today I put some ketchup, nutritional yeast and ground cashew nuts on top of the sprouts.
While ketchup is not exactly a whole food, [the one that I use](https://www.felix.se/products/ketchup-osotad/)
from Felix seems to not include too much crap and taste wise is almost closer to a tomato paste than
your regular ketchup.
Maybe I should try this with tomato paste instead. 🤔

Also washed the other sprouts.

Also washed the sprouts and setup some new ones.

#### 10:15 Coconut Oil

#### 10:43 Lemon water & breakfast

![Breakfast](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-breakfast.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

On weekends, I usually get up a bit later and will combine the lemon water with the oat meal.

Also washed the sprouts.

#### 13:49 Smoothie

![Smoothie](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-smoothie.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Throw everything into the blender and blend. 🌝
Spinach, to me, is the one vegetable that I can almost not put too much of into smoothies.
Blueberries are just as good in smoothies as they are in oat meal.

#### 16:15 Dinner preparations

I usually follow my adaptation of [this recipe](https://www.theedgyveg.com/2015/04/20/jackfruit-carnitas-pulled-pork-tacos/)
mainly leaving out the oil and making it more spicy.

#### Taco filling

This time we decided to try out swapping out the jack fruit for mushrooms.
The result being slightly better taste but considerably worse texture than with jack fruit.
Also it was significantly more expensive to use mushrooms as they shrink so much during cooking.

![Mushroom taco filling](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-mushrooms-pre.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

![Mushroom taco filling](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-mushrooms-post.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

#### Mango salsa

![Mango Salsa](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-salsa.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Chop all the ingredients and mix them with a pinch of salt.
It can be difficult to get good fresh mango, especially on short notice.
Frozen mango does the job just fine.

#### Cashew lime cream

![Cashew Lime Cream](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-cream.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Soak the cashews in water for several hours.
If you are short on time, you can use boiling water and the cashews should be about soft enough
after an hour.
Then simply follow the recipe.
My friend did not have apple cider vinegar, it's also fine without.
I find that 60g of cashews will be fine for 12 tacos (1 can of jack fruit).

#### Tortillas

![Tortillas](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-tortillas.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

If you are eating tacos and are not preparing your own tortillas, you are doing it wrong.
Just get the corn masa (has to be the [nixtamalizado stuff](https://www.naturelo.com.mx/ing/maizazul.php))
and mix it with water, form balls from it
(I find 33g to be result the perfect *3 bite taco* size) and then press them into shape
in a plastic bag between two flat surfaces (a pot and the kitchen counter worked fine here).

A good mixture of flour and water today was 265ml of water for the 180g of flour and resulted
in 13 tortillas.

Press them quite thin and roast them in a preheated pan at medium heat, turning them around at least once.
If you are doing this the first time, make sure that you taste one of them before cooking all of them,
as you might not have made them thin enough and they can be raw on the inside.

#### 18:38 Dinner

![Tacos](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-taco.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

![Tacos](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-tacos.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

I put some hot sauce on this, which would have been too difficult to track.

#### 19:47 Ice cream

![Magnum almond](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/saturday-ice-cream.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

This is my go-to vegan ice cream, that is widely available.
It has been quite some years since I have had the non-vegan version but these days
I cannot imagine that it would taste any better.

#### 23:00

Washed the sprouts

#### 11:40 Coconut Oil

Also washed the sprouts.

#### 12:10 Breakfast

![Breakfast](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/sunday-breakfast.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Also washed and soaked some buckwheat for dinner.

#### 14:25 Cycling snack

![Isotonic drink and banana](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/sunday-iso.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

A bit longer bike ride today, so I am also taking a banana.

#### 16:28 Lunch & Dinner prep

#### Potato fries

![Fries in the oven](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/sunday-fries-pre.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

A common misconception is that you need oil for crunchy fries.
If you have parchment paper or a silicone sheet however, you can simply throw potato fries
or wedges on there and put some spices on top.
I used turmeric, smoked paprika, chili and a pinch of salt.
Unfortunately I don't have garlic and onion powder at hand right now.
Those are a real game changer for fries.

Make sure that the fries are evenly spaced and don't overlap too much.
Then you just pop them in the oven at 200°C for 50 minutes and turn them around half way through.

If you want them extra good, you cook the fries for 10 minutes before rinsing them and placing them
on the tray.

#### Buckwheat tortillas

![Buckwheat mixture](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/sunday-buckwheat-blended.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Now this recipe blew my mind, when I first found out about it and I ate buckwheat tortillas
every day for several weeks :)
Here is [the first recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuUX_lX-hm4) I followed.
You don't even need a high powered blender,
as a stick blender will do the job just fine.
And they are so incredibly versatile.
You can prepare them with varying thickness to achieve, crepes, wraps or pancakes.
You can add all kinds of spices and then have them with peanut butter and banana,
chocolate cream, blueberries, maple syrup or, like I today, as savory wraps.

For a more savory dish, like today, I add rosemary and garlic.

Make sure that you rinse the buckwheat properly before you mix it with fresh water and blend it.
You can start with less water and then add more until you get the desired consistency for your paste.
For 204g of buckwheat my entire mixture today turned out to be 625g.

Then just follow the instructions in the video I linked.
You almost impossible to fuck these up if your pan has some non-sick properties.

#### 19:14 Dinner

![Buckwheat wraps](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/sunday-dinner.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

I just filled the wraps with some vegetables I had in the oven for half an hour,
some sprouts and some sesame sauce (just stirred tahini, warm water, nutritional yeast and garlic).

I did not eat all the wraps at once but ate them throughout the evening.

![buckwheat wrap](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/sunday-wrap.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

#### 22:48 Orange snack

![Orange](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/sunday-orange.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Ate an orange because I was craving something cold and fresh after lunch and dinner.
I was too lazy but should have juiced it instead.
Eating a citrus fruit so close before brushing my teeth was not optimal.

Also washed the sprouts.

# Results

## Nutrients

I slightly adjusted the default cronometer settings for my increased calorie intake.
However, I left it on the default settings for micro nutrients.

Here are the result for the week:

![Cronometer results](/assets/img/blog/diet-review/cronometer-week-result.jpg){:class="blog-post-img-large"}

### Macro Nutrients

I don't watch how many carbs I consume and am really not concerned about getting enough protein.
My weight is quite steady at 69kg and I am not aiming at becoming Mr. Olympia.
Most of my training is cycling and also there I don't try to build huge muscles.

I try to keep the fat to a reasonable amount, which can get tricky when burning a lot of calories.

Looking at what contributed to the fat over the week, the coconut flakes in the breakfast and smoothies
are quite up there considering how little they do for taste.
I have tried the oat meal without the coconut flakes since looking at the numbers and don't miss them.
I think they served some purpose when switching from chocolate oat drink
to cocoa powder and water but considering that more than half their
weight is saturated fats, they are not worth it in the long run.

### Omega-3 to Omega-6 Ratio

The ratio during this week seems to be about 1:2.
Of course it would be better to get closer to 1:1 but 1:2 is already quite good.

### Vitamin E and Calcium Fix

The week results show an slight deficiency in Vitamin E and Calcium.

Both of them should not be any problem if you are eating processed foods as you will find many foods
fortified with them.

They can be a bit more tricky, if you don't consume processed foods, and don't know what foods contain
significant amounts of them.
This week I at a coconut milk sauce on three days.
A prominent alternative for this would be a sesame sauce, the tahini of which already covers about
a third of the daily need.

A great Vitamin E source is spinach.
A daily portion in your smoothie and you get more than enough.

I plan to swap the peanut butter in my oat meal with almond butter.
Almond butter is a bit more difficult to get in Gothenburg, which is why have been using peanut butter
in the oat meal lately.
From a taste and nutrient perspective however, I think I will be okay with the additional effort
and also price, almond butter is significantly more expensive than peanut butter.

This is how the nutrient result would look with almond butter in the breakfast:

# Selenium

I got a comment questioning the Selenium value.
Cronometer lists brown rice and oats as the two main contributors here.
Since half of the rice and all of the oats I consume come from Europe
the Selenium score is probably less than 200% and might not even be 100%.
Brazil nuts however are a safe way to make sure that you are getting
your Selenium dose and they are also really delicious. :)
I got organic brazil nuts at the grocery store for 1 SEK a piece and one of them already
fills my daily Selenium need.

Average daily calories: **3625kcal**

The daily costs have a git outlier in saturday.
While I will have days with more expensive meals from time to time, or even dine out,
extreme days like this don't happen with a weekly basis.

A 140 SEK/day diet would cost about 4200SEK per month.

### Conclusions

Having not tracked my food intake in a while I can definitely say that I did not miss it.
Especially documenting everything in here and calculating the cost was no fun :).
This week however, seemed like a good enough representation for my diet in the recent weeks.
So I am at least happy with how that turned out.

If I do something similar again I will definitely track everything in
a spreadsheet instead of taking notes in a markdown file and doing
calculations by hand.
I have to admit that I underestimated the effort for this experiment.
🤦‍♂️

It would be good to track time in the kitchen and actual time eating the next time.
However, it would not have made sense to do it during this week since the tracking and taking photos took
quite some time and would have distorted the actual time.
Maybe use something like [jiffy](https://jiffy.nu/) to track it properly.

It would also be interesting to measure the amount of packaging that
the food comes in.
One week would not be representative enough for this though.

## Changes

* I was hoping the cost of my diet would be below 4000SEK but considering the amount of calories,
I consumed during the week, I think it's fine.
I had already planned to source staples of my diet, both from a cost and packaging perspective,
of the internet, where I can buy them in bulk.
I would like to buy spices at [pikantum](https://www.pikantum.de/),
and rice, beans and co. at [RAPUNZEL](https://shop.rapunzel.de/) and [prohviant](https://www.prohviant.de/).

* Since the first shopping after the experiment I started using almond
butter in my oat meal instead of peanut butter.

* I removed the coconut flakes from my oat meal.

* I am thinking about checking my Omega-3 index to see how good my
absorption from the flax seeds is.

* I want to try to sprout the flax seeds instead of consuming them
grounded in the oat meal.
I consume flax seeds mainly for the Omega-3 and this process is
supposed to increase its availability.

* I bought some brazil nuts and am consuming them daily for the Selenium.

## Price List

I added the name of the store where I bought the food and if there is no link
I will provide the link to an alternative store.
Please notice that the prices and package sizes can differ.
Also ICA online prices seem to be higher than what I pay in the store.

I bought my chili and coriander powder somewhere in India and they are not organic.
So I took the price and the link of the next chili powder that I am going to buy.
