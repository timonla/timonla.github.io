It has been almost two years since I posted a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItTN2dbPMiE&t=140s)
on my bike packing setup.
Since then and especially in preparation for riding the
[Length of Sweden](https://sverigetempot.wordpress.com/),
I have iterated upon this setup quite a lot.
One of the biggest improvements has been the recent switch to a
[tailfin carbon rack](https://www.tailfin.cc/product/pannier-racks/carbon-rack/) and
[trunk top bag](https://www.tailfin.cc/product/pannier-trunk-bags/aeropack-trunk-top-bag/). 

Previously my bike-packing gear was carried in the Ortlieb
[handlebar-pack](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/handlebar-pack) and
[seat-pack](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/seat-pack+F9902).
Now the trunk top bag replaces both of these and after only a few trips,
I already know that I never want to go back!

In this post I document the basics of the current setup, consisting of the bags
and sleep system, and how to pack it.
For that I introduce my sleep setup in detail and discuss different packing techniques
and principles before comparing the Ortlieb bike-packing bag setup with the
tailfin rack and trunk top bag.

# Sleep system

The picture shows my complete sleep system next to a 1 liter bottle for size.
From top to bottom and left to right, it shows my sleeping bag, tent body,
sleeping pad, emergency bivy and tent poles + pegs.

## Tent

Every part of a bike-packing setup is a compromise between weight, pack-size, cost, 
durability and comfort.
The [Naturehike Tagar 1](https://www.naturehike.com/products/naturehike-ultralight-20d-camping-backpack-tagar-tent-for-1-2-person-nh17t140-j-1)
ticks most of these boxes.
It offers all the comfort I could wish for in a small and light-weight package.
Of course [much lighter and smaller solutions](https://borahgear.com/cubenbivy.html) exist
but with much less comfort.
I would have chosen the Tagar independent of the price because I could not find a better
alrounder but it happens to also be much cheaper than the competition.

![Naturehike Tagar 1](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/naturehike-tagar-1.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

The Tagar is really easy to setup and also packs down easily.
I can sit upright in the tent, with enough room for my sleeping pad and bag
and some gear.
(I am 176cm tall at 68kg) When I researched tents it was the lightest and smallest that
would come with this level of comfort at just under 1.2 kg (1165g with 8 pegs and no cords) 
and fit easily inside my handlebar bag.
To achieve the low weight and packing size, the material is quite thin, which
probably has an effect on durability and longevity.
So far I have not encountered any issues with the tent though.
It also comes with an additional ground sheet (not included in the weight)
for extra protection.
Additionally the Tagar saves weight and size by combining the inner tent and rain fly on
large areas of the tent body.

The only real issue with the Tagar seems to be condensation in wet and cold conditions.
However, this seemed to be an issue with each and every one-person tent that I looked at.
Wiping the inside and outside with a towel in the morning works well for me,
even when camping in the rain.

## Sleeping pad

This year I switched to an insulated sleeping pad.
I really liked the comfort of the [Nemo Astro](https://www.nemoequipment.com/product/astro/)
(green on the left) but especially when sleeping close to the water and after long exhausting
days in the saddle, the insulation allows for camping in much colder weather.
I upgraded to the [Nemo Tensor](https://www.nemoequipment.com/product/tensor/)
(yellow on the right).

The [R-value](https://www.thermarest.com/blog/r-value-meaning/) of the non-insulated Astro pad is 1.5 while that of the insulated Tensor is
3.5, really getting the most out of my sleeping bag.

While the Tensor is already lighter than the Astro, I went ahead and switched to a smaller
size as well, going from 710g for the non-insulated Astro in the long and wide size to
425g for the insulated Tensor in the regular rectangular size.

![Sleeping Pad](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/sleeping-pad.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

## Sleeping bag

For a sleeping bag I use the [a cheap decathlon model](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/trekking-mummy-sleeping-bag-trek-500-15-c-wadding-twinnable/_/R-p-313095).
It has a comfort rating of 15°C.
I managed to get some sleep in it below 6°C, with high humidity and a lot of wind,
back with the non-insulated Astro pad and some cycling clothes on.
I hope the insulated Tensor sleeping pad will allow me to use it during even colder nights.
(I am a cold sleeper though)

Using the included pack sack, the sleeping bag can be compressed to compressed quite a lot.

## Emergency bivy

For emergency weather situations I carry an
[emergency bivy](https://www.mountain-equipment.co.uk/products/ultralite-bivi)
with me.
It takes up almost no space and weighs next to nothing (108g) but can provide a lot of
warms if the situation gets really dire.
Basically a rescue blanket in the shape of a sleeping bag, it is quite popular with
ultra endurance riders.
I used it during the last night of the length of sweden tour for a short nap.

![Emergency Bivy](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/emergency-bivy.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

It can be used multiple times if handled with care, but it is impossible to re-pack
it as neatly as it comes out of the box.

# Packing

How the system can fit inside the bike-packing bags, depends a lot on the packing.
I chose to carry my sleep system (except for the tent poles) in the handlebar bag because
I did not want to carry too much weight on the 
handlebars and the handlebar bag is quite difficult to access during the day,
especially when using [aero bars](https://www.profile-design-eu.com/collections/aerobars/products/sonic-ergo-35a).
Perfect for the sleep system.

A lot of things are not needed and should be left at home.
So far I have never used the tent cords and consequently I can also leave four pegs at home.
I often ditch the ground sheet as well and pack the tent body in a smaller pack-sack
(the pack sack of my Nemo Astro sleeping pad).

![Tent Extras](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/tent-extras.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

The Nemo Tensor sleeping pad also comes with some accessories.
Taking the patch kit (left) is a no-brainer but the pump-sack (middle) is more of a
luxury item.
For now I have taken the pack-sack (right) and will continue to do so until I am
confident enough in the durability of the sleeping pad.

![Sleeping Pad extras](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/sleeping-pad-extras.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

I used to ditch all the pack-sacks but recently figured out how to compress the tent body
and sleeping bag using pack-sacks, which makes a big difference in the Tailfin trunk top bag.
The trunk top bag even fits the tent poles, which I used to carry in a frame bag.
Without a frame bag, they could probably be strapped to the frame in some other way.

The following photos show the Ortlieb handlebar bag with the entire sleep setup inside,
first without a pack-sack for the sleeping bag and then with the sleeping bag
inside a pack-sack.

![Handlebar Bag with Pack Sacks](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/handlebar-bag-with-pack-sacks.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

Either way the drops position is pretty much rendered useless by the handlebar bag, which is
why I am so happy that I no longer need it with the tailfin setup.
The handlebar is a [Bontrager Elite Aero VR-CF](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/equipment/cycling-components/bike-handlebars-accessories/bike-handlebars/road-bike-handlebars/bontrager-elite-aero-vr-cf-road-handlebar/p/23238/) handlebars in size 420mm.

# Tailfin rack - the good and the bad

The short version is that I am amazed by the Tailfin rack and trunk top bag.
I found some issues and room for improvement with the system, which I describe in
detail below.
However, even with these issues, I would buy the combination again any day.

The long version I split my review into different topics and layout the positive
and negative aspects for each of them.

## Packing

The biggest advantages of the trunk top bag compared to conventional seat-packs is the ease
with which it can be packed. 
Especially when choosing the rack version over the [aero pack](https://www.tailfin.cc/product/seat-packs/aeropack-carbon/),
the ability to simply take the pack off the bike increases packability immensely.

I chose the rack and trunk top bag so that I can easily take the bag off the bike
when going into a store or taking it into the tent at night.
Other configurations of the tailfin rack will offer a slightly worse versatility
but except for the direct frame mount aero pack version, all of them are much better
than a conventional seat-pack.

The biggest problem I have with the rack version is the inability to access the bag on the
bike.
For riders with low saddle heights, like me, the pack is difficult to fit on the rack
and can only be accessed properly when off the bike.
For the aero pack Tailfin offers an [extension](https://www.tailfin.cc/product/spares/accessories-accessories/extended-aeropack-seatpost-connector/)
to move the seat pack further away from the saddle.
Until this part is also available for the trunk top bag version, only the zipper on the side
allows for proper access while the pack is on the bike.
This zipper on the other hand is a great addition.
Putting my rain jacket, first aid kit and foldable backpack directly behind the zipper, I
usually don't have the need to open the pack during the day.

## Riding comfort

Compared with a conventional seat-pack, the trunk top bag sits rock solid behind the saddle.
The difference in riding comfort is mainly due to the fact that the bike is 1-2 times than
without any luggage.
The rack is in a completely different league than seat-packs, like
[the Ortlieb one I used before](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/seat-pack+F9902).

The biggest improvement in riding comfort however is the removal of the handlebar-pack.
I am able to fit almost everything that previously went into the handlebar-pack and the
seat-pack into the trunk top bag and thus got back a lot of previously blocked hand positions
and handling comfort.

## Modularity

The very important bit of information I was missing in all the reviews I looked at,
when deciding for it, was the modularity of the setup.

When you order a tailfin rack or aero pack, you get a bunch of boxes and put together 
whatever you configured in their shop.
If you bought the arch without pannier mounts and change your mind later on,
you can simply buy a different arch and modify your setup.
The same goes for the aero pack.
You can easily convert your setup to the rack + trunk top bag setup like I have it
here with some adapters.

![Tailfin Packaging](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/tailfin-packaging.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

What held me back from investing in the tailfin rack for my first bike packing trip
was the fact that I did not know what setup I would really need down the line and
the price for the most versatile setup (5 754 SEK for the X rack carbon with the
trunk top bag).

Knowing what I know today, I would have never bought the Ortlieb bags in the first place.
I spent 2 615 SEK on my Ortlieb handlebar bag and seat pack while I could have gotten 
the Aero pack alloy for 2 223 SEK and the carbon version for 2 812 SEK.
That is with frame mounting, since my bike has the mounts for that.

Functionally that setup would have been quite comparable to the Ortlieb bags, as in difficult to put on and take off the bike and not so nice top pack on the bike.
I decided on the S rack carbon with the trunk top bag.
This allows me to take the bag with me when I go into stores and to place it in the vestibule of the tent at night.
If I ever decide to ride with pannier bags again or if tailfin releases a laptop bag like the modified THULE ones they have provided to YouTubers, I can just buy an alloy arch and be setup.
With heavier pannier setups, I do not expect the weight penalty of the alloy are to be so significant.

The sleep system in the trunk top bag.
There is still a lot of room for other stuff.
To give you an idea, i tested how many cotton T-Shirts I could stuff in there on top of the sleep setup.
The answer is 14 size M T-Shirts!

## Bonus: Additional Bags

I complete my bike-packing setup with some apidura bags, a fanny pack and a foldable
backpack.

### Top tube pack

I carry most electronics and security items (alarm and lock) in a 2l
[Apidura top tube pack](https://www.apidura.com/shop/racing-long-top-tube-pack/).

### Food pouch

As the name suggests, I use the 1.2l [Apidura food pouch](https://www.apidura.com/shop/backcountry-food-pouch/)
for food storage to be accessed during the day.
It fits neatly betweene the aero-pars and the side pockets are great to safely store any
wrappers or other scrap in between stops.

![Food Pouch](/assets/img/blog/bike-packing-setup/food-pouch.png){:class="blog-post-img-small"}

### Fanny pack

I keep all important stuff like phone, money, keys, hygienics in a [Vaude Tecomove II](https://www.vaude.com/en-INT/Equipment/Packs-n-Bags-Luggage/Waist-Bag/28135/Tecomove-II-Waist-bag)
fanny pack so that I don't have to take them out of the bags during every stop.
The pack is not waterproof, so most stuff is in plastic bags.

### Foldable backpack

To carry food from the last supermarket stop to the camp side I use an [Osprey Ultralight Stuff Pack](https://www.ospreyeurope.com/shop/de_de/ultralight-stuff-pack).
