I recently got my first experience with development for the iX platform.
This was my first time, writing C# code for an embedded system and the .NET
Compact Framework 3.5 (.NET CF).
Having some experience with test driven development (TDD), using Visual Studio
(VS), I natrually did not want to throw everything over board and spent quite
some time initally to find a good workflow and project setup, which I try to
document in this post.
This is by no means the ultimate or only way to do TDD for .NET compact framework 3.5 in Visual Studio, it's merely what worked well for me.
If you have some additional input, I am happy to improve both, my workflow and this blog post with your suggestions :).

My experience with this setup is specific as an alternative to working in Beijer
iX Developer (iX). Parts of this post might be helpful for similar platforms
with .NET CF as well.

## Why do TDD and why use Visual Studio over iX Developer?

This post won't go into details on why a TDD approach should be prefered as soon
as the logic of the C# scripts gets a  big more complex than mapping values to
UI fields.
Robert C. Martin gives an excellent introduction and motivation for TDD in
[this presentation by Robert C. Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U).

However, there are many advantages of using VS over iX if you are using TDD or
not. Here is a list of features that will make one's life much easier

* Navigation through files, auto completion

* Extension support, such as VsVim

* It comes with a lot of useful refactoring tools (even more if you are using resharper)

* Native dark mode :new_moon_with_face:

* And of course the community version is free to use and works just fine.

* Well, and of course the excellent test runner.

## Limitations of Beijer iX Developer compared to .NET compact framework 3.5

* Beijer does not support named parameters in the IDE but happily compiles the code for you.

* Beijer does only allow auto-implemented properties if you specify both `get` and `set`. `{ get; }` alone as you would use for a `readonly` property, is not supported.

* Beijer doew not allow arrow functions.

## Setup your Visual Studio project for compact framework development

The biggest pitfall when developing your code for Beijer in Visual Studio and then compiling it in iX developer is to not setup your Visual Studio project correctly and end up using features and libraries that are not supported by the compact framework.
Officially support for .NET CF development ends with Visual Studio 2008 but there is a way to configure your project for later versions as well.
I used [this setup guide](https://gist.github.com/skarllot/4953ddb6e23d8a6f0816029c4155997a) to configure my project in Visual Studio 2019 without problems.
Apparently the download of Power Toys is not available anymore [use the web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/a/c/fac1342d-044d-4d88-ae97-d278ef697064/NETCFv35PowerToys.msi) to access it anyways.

## How to structure your project

There are a few caveats when it comes to creating and structuring the script
files.
First of all, new script files must be created in iX, as there are two files
that will be created alongside the `MyScriptName.Script.cs` file.
As soon as you created the file it is recommended to close iX immediately so
that one does not accidentally make changes and override the process from VS.
Open it again if you need to make changes to the tags or the UI.

* What is going on with internal classes in iX developer and what is generated automatically as partial classes for script files?

* Internal classes and test objects

* How to choose namespace names and class names.

* Don't name your classes like you name your files.

* Don't name your classes like you name your name spaces either.

## What to do with tags

The logic that you implement needs to be connected to the tags that you can use in the UI elements in some way.
One solution is to work fully stateless and apply the effects of your logic in
the generated module that has access to the tags.
The option I went for is to create a `VariableReference` structure and pass
those to the business logic to write to it directly.
This has the advantage that I can easily test the effects of different methods
on each other and can even simulate an entire sequence of function calls.

### VariableReference

I created the class `VariableReference` that has a `Get` and `Set` method to
which I can then map the respective functions of the tags.


```cs
internal class VariableReference<T> {
	public Func<T> Get { get; private set; }
	public Action<T> Set { get; private set; }

	public VariableReference(Func<T> getter, Action<T> setter) {
		Get = getter;
		Set = setter;
	}
}
```

Using this class one can then create a class containing all the tags needed in
the business logic.

```cs
internal class MyBusinessLogicTags {
	public readonly VariableReference<string> SomeTagName;
	public readonly VariableReference<bool> SomeOtherTagName;

	public MyBusinessLogicTagNames(
		VariableReference<string> someTagName = null,
		VariableReference<bool> someOtherTagName = null
	) {
		SomeTagName = someTagName;
		SomeOtherTagName = someOtherTagName;
	}
}
```

### Instantiate

In the generated script module, which has access to the tags, I will instantiate
a tag container that maps the read and write operations on the tags to the
`VariableReferences`. Here are some examples:

```cs
public partial class MyModule {
	static MyBusinessLogicTags myTags = new MyBusinessLogicTags(
		new VariableReference<string>(
			() => Globals.Tags.SomeTagName.Value,
			val => { Globals.Tags.SomeTagName.Value = val; }),
		new VariableReference<bool>(
			() => Globals.Tags.SomeOtherTagName.Value,
			val => { Globals.Tags.SomeOtherTagName.SetTag(); })
	);
}
```

This tag container is then passed as a parameter to the constructor of my
business logic module.

### Helper functions for testing

For testing purposes you should create something similar.

```cs
class Helpers {
	class TagContainer {
		public string someTagName;
		public bool someOtherTagName;

		public TagContainer() {
			someTagName = "";
			someOtherTagName = false;
		}
	}

	public static MyBusinessLogicTags CreateTags() {
		var tagContainer = new TagContainer();

		return new MyBusinessLogicTags(
			someTagName: new VariableReference<string>(
				() => tagContainer.someTagName,
				val => { tagContainer.someTagName = val; }),
			someOtherTagName: new VariableReference<string>(
				() => tagContainer.someOtherTagName,
				val => { tagContainer.someOtherTagName = val; })
		);
	}
}
```
