I recently gained my first experience writing `C#` code for an embedded system using the .NET Compact Framework 3.5 (.NET CF),
in particular the development of [iX software](https://www.beijerelectronics.com/en/Products/Operator___panels/iX___Software)
for a [Beijer HMI panel](https://www.beijerelectronics.com/en/Products/Operator___panels).
For the development of iX software, Beijer provides an IDE, called iX Developer.
Unsurprisingly, iX Developer felt like quite the downgrade, for all non UI parts of the implementation, compared to
Visual Studio (VS), which I was used to.
I also had no idea how to properly test my business logic without it.
So I sat down and tried to figure out a setup that would allow me to follow a test driven development (TDD)
workflow in VS and still end up with code that would compile properly in iX Developer,
since the IDE is used to load the software onto the panel later.
It took a while to find a good setup and along the way I uncovered quite a few pitfalls.
Hence, I decided to document my approach here, so that it can be a resource to you, if you are attempting something similar.
Or you can point out what I am still missing, because this is by no means the ultimate or only way to do TDD
for .NET CF in VS, it's merely what worked well for me so far.

My experience with this setup is specific to Beijer iX Developer.
However, parts of this post could be helpful for similar platforms with .NET CF as well.

## Why do TDD and why use Visual Studio over iX Developer?

This post won't go into details on why a TDD approach should be preferred as soon
as the logic of the C# scripts gets a  big more complex than mapping values to
UI fields.
Robert C. Martin gives an excellent introduction and motivation for TDD in
[this presentation by Robert C. Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U).

However, there are many advantages of using VS over iX if you are using TDD or
not. Here is a list of features that will make one's life much easier

* Navigation through files, auto completion

* Extension support, such as VsVim

* It comes with a lot of useful refactoring tools (even more if you are using resharper)

* Native dark mode :new_moon_with_face:

* And of course the community version is free to use and works just fine.

* Well, and of course the excellent test runner.

## Limitations of Beijer iX Developer compared to .NET compact framework 3.5

* Beijer does not support named parameters in the IDE but happily compiles the code for you.

* Beijer does only allow auto-implemented properties if you specify both `get` and `set`. `{ get; }` alone as you would use for a `readonly` property, is not supported.

* Beijer does not allow arrow functions.

## Setup your Visual Studio project for compact framework development

The biggest pitfall when developing your code for Beijer in Visual Studio and then compiling it in iX developer is to not setup your Visual Studio project correctly and end up using features and libraries that are not supported by the compact framework.
Officially support for .NET CF development ends with Visual Studio 2008 but there is a way to configure your project for later versions as well.
I used [this setup guide](https://gist.github.com/skarllot/4953ddb6e23d8a6f0816029c4155997a) to configure my project in Visual Studio 2019 without problems.
Apparently the download of Power Toys is not available anymore [use the web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/a/c/fac1342d-044d-4d88-ae97-d278ef697064/NETCFv35PowerToys.msi) to access it anyways.

## How to structure your project

There are a few caveats when it comes to creating and structuring the script
files.
First of all, new script files must be created in iX, as there are two files
that will be created alongside the `MyScriptName.Script.cs` file.
As soon as you created the file it is recommended to close iX immediately so
that one does not accidentally make changes and override the process from VS.
Open it again if you need to make changes to the tags or the UI.

* What is going on with internal classes in iX developer and what is generated automatically as partial classes for script files?

* Internal classes and test objects

* How to choose namespace names and class names.

* Don't name your classes like you name your files.

* Don't name your classes like you name your name spaces either.

## What to do with tags

The logic that you implement needs to be connected to the tags that you can use in the UI elements in some way.
One solution is to work fully stateless and apply the effects of your logic in
the generated module that has access to the tags.
The option I went for is to create a `VariableReference` structure and pass
those to the business logic to write to it directly.
This has the advantage that I can easily test the effects of different methods
on each other and can even simulate an entire sequence of function calls.

### VariableReference

I created the class `VariableReference` that has a `Get` and `Set` method to
which I can then map the respective functions of the tags.


```cs
internal class VariableReference<T> {
	public Func<T> Get { get; private set; }
	public Action<T> Set { get; private set; }

	public VariableReference(Func<T> getter, Action<T> setter) {
		Get = getter;
		Set = setter;
	}
}
```

Using this class one can then create a class containing all the tags needed in
the business logic.

```cs
internal class MyBusinessLogicTags {
	public readonly VariableReference<string> SomeTagName;
	public readonly VariableReference<bool> SomeOtherTagName;

	public MyBusinessLogicTagNames(
		VariableReference<string> someTagName = null,
		VariableReference<bool> someOtherTagName = null
	) {
		SomeTagName = someTagName;
		SomeOtherTagName = someOtherTagName;
	}
}
```

### Instantiate

In the generated script module, which has access to the tags, I will instantiate
a tag container that maps the read and write operations on the tags to the
`VariableReferences`. Here are some examples:

```cs
public partial class MyModule {
	static MyBusinessLogicTags myTags = new MyBusinessLogicTags(
		new VariableReference<string>(
			() => Globals.Tags.SomeTagName.Value,
			val => { Globals.Tags.SomeTagName.Value = val; }),
		new VariableReference<bool>(
			() => Globals.Tags.SomeOtherTagName.Value,
			val => { Globals.Tags.SomeOtherTagName.SetTag(); })
	);
}
```

This tag container is then passed as a parameter to the constructor of my
business logic module.

### Helper functions for testing

For testing purposes you should create something similar.

```cs
class Helpers {
	class TagContainer {
		public string someTagName;
		public bool someOtherTagName;

		public TagContainer() {
			someTagName = "";
			someOtherTagName = false;
		}
	}

	public static MyBusinessLogicTags CreateTags() {
		var tagContainer = new TagContainer();

		return new MyBusinessLogicTags(
			someTagName: new VariableReference<string>(
				() => tagContainer.someTagName,
				val => { tagContainer.someTagName = val; }),
			someOtherTagName: new VariableReference<string>(
				() => tagContainer.someOtherTagName,
				val => { tagContainer.someOtherTagName = val; })
		);
	}
}
```
