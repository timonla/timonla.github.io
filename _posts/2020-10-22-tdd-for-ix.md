Developing [iX software](https://www.beijerelectronics.com/en/Products/Operator___panels/iX___Software)
for a [Beijer HMI panel](https://www.beijerelectronics.com/en/Products/Operator___panels)
was my first encounter with the .NET Compact Framework 3.5 (.NET CF) and my first time
writing `C#` code outside of Visual Studio (VS).

To compile your project and load it onto the panel, Beijer provides the iX Developer IDE,
which unsurprisingly feels like quite the downgrade from VS,
for everything not UI related.
Especially writing tests for the business logic is not a trivial task.
That's why I chose to document the motivation and the setup details for a proper test driven
development (TDD) workflow in VS, that still produces code that still compiles in iX Developer.

My experience with this setup is specific to Beijer iX Developer.
However, parts of this post could be helpful for similar platforms with .NET CF as well.
This is also by no means the ultimate guide to either working with iX and VS or for TDD.
I drew inspiration from [Jeff's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvciPAOAnpM)
and found a setup that works well for me.
I am happy about any suggestions on how to improve it!

The example project, which I reference in this blog post, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/timonla/border-patrol).

### Advantages of Visual Studio over iX Developer

While the preferred development methodology for any pair of two software projects
might look quite different, it is difficult to deny the advantages of being
able to test an implementation reliably.
The importance of testability only increases in the context of embedded and potentially
safety critical software.
For writing business logic, the [VS test explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer?view=vs-2019)
alone should be motivation enough to look into a possible setup using VS.

For building the UI and wiring up the interface to the business logic,
one should still use iX Developer - this is where it shines.
The setup documented in this blog post requires some interaction
with iX Developer, even for the business logic parts.
However, after an initial effort to define the interface the business logic uses
to communicate with the UI, it only needs to be opened occasionaly.

On top of the test explorer, VS comes with a few more treats, such as:
* A great debugger
* Swift navigation to definitions and references
* Interactive error and warning messages
* Extension support, such as [VsVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaredParMSFT.VsVim)
* Automatic formatting
* Refactoring functionality (even more so with access to [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/))
* Dark mode ðŸŒš and other themes 
* And more ...

There is a good chance that you are eligible for the free VS [community version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/),
which has all the functionality you need, or you are already paying for it anyways.

### Test driven development approach

I will not go into detail about TDD in this blog post but for those new to it,
the basic concept goes something like this:

* Write failing tests first, specifying the expected behavior of the implementation
* Write the code that is needed to pass the test cases
* Refactor the code

To add more requirements, simply add new test cases and repeat the steps above.
The pattern is called:
<span style="color: Salmon">Red</span> â†’
<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">Green</span> â†’
<span style="color:CornflowerBlue">Refactor</span>.
With this approach one is less likely to implement any unneeded functionality
and does not have to be afraid of refactoring the implementation.
As long as all test cases are all green, nothing can break.
It's also a very rewarding process since one is constantly returning to a state where
everything is working fine and it is easy to backtrack to it.
On top of that, where a test case is failing, there is always input data for that scenario,
to debug it with.
Of course in the beginning everything will go a bit slower.

Robert C. Martin gives an excellent introduction to and motivation for TDD in
[this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U).

### Setup a Visual Studio project for compact framework development

The biggest pitfall when developing for iX in VS and then compiling
the project in iX Developer is to not setup the VS project correctly and ending
up using features and libraries that are not available for .NET CF.
Officially, support for .NET CF development ends with VS 2008 but there is
a way to configure the project for later versions as well.
I followed [this setup guide](https://gist.github.com/skarllot/4953ddb6e23d8a6f0816029c4155997a)
to configure my project in VS 2019 without any problems.
Apparently the download of Power Toys, linked in that post, is not available anymore.

to the rescue. ðŸ¦¸

### How to structure the project

There are a few caveats when it comes to creating and structuring the script files, that I have
encountered so far and will explain in this section.

I created the [border-patrol](https://github.com/timonla/border-patrol) example that outlines
the project structure I am using.
The code was written using the TDD pattern and the cases following the `NUnit` naming scheme,
I documented in an earlier [blog post](https://timon.la/blog/bdd-nunit-test-naming/).
It also includes a [.gitignore](https://github.com/timonla/border-patrol/blob/main/.gitignore)
that I would recommend copying when using a version control system (which you should!).

First of all, new script files must be created in iX Developer, as there are two files
that will be created alongside the `[script name].Script.cs` file.
Once the script files are created, I recommend to close iX Developer immediately, to
reduce the risk of accidentally making changes and overriding the progress from VS.
Jut open it again to make changes to the interface between the UI and the business logic
or the UI itself.

#### Caveats

Because iX will generate some classes it is a good idea to avoid certain
class names alltogether to not run into issues.
For the script file `WalkerModule.Script.cs`, iX generates a partial class `WalkerModule`.
In these partial classes one can access the `tags`, which is why we will use them to
create a wrapper for the business logic to connect to the UI but we want to avoid naming
classes of the business logic like that.

* Classes cannot have the same name as namespaces

#### What goes into which file?

* What is going on with internal classes in iX developer and what is generated automatically as partial classes for script files?
* Internal classes and test objects
* How to choose namespace names and class names.
* Don't name classes like files.
* Don't name classes like namespaces either.

### Interface between UI and business logic

The content displayed in UI components can be set using `tags`.
These are difficult to access outside of iX Developer.


`Tags` are the interface between the UI and the business logic.
To access the `tags` from the business logic, there are two basic approaches.

1. Implement the entire business logic stateless (functional) and build a wrapper around
it that will feed it with `tag` values and update `tags` with the return values.
2. Create a stupid wrapper, that wraps the `tags` in `VariableReferences` so that the
business logic can update them directly.

#### VariableReference

I created the class `VariableReference` that has a `Get` and `Set` method to
which I can then map the respective functions of the `tags`.


```cs
internal class VariableReference<T> {
	public Func<T> Get { get; private set; }
	public Action<T> Set { get; private set; }

	public VariableReference(Func<T> getter, Action<T> setter) {
		Get = getter;
		Set = setter;
	}
}
```

Using this class one can then create a class containing all the tags needed in
the business logic.

```cs
internal class MyBusinessLogicTags {
	public readonly VariableReference<string> SomeTagName;
	public readonly VariableReference<bool> SomeOtherTagName;

	public MyBusinessLogicTagNames(
		VariableReference<string> someTagName = null,
		VariableReference<bool> someOtherTagName = null
	) {
		SomeTagName = someTagName;
		SomeOtherTagName = someOtherTagName;
	}
}
```

#### Instantiate

In the generated script module, which has access to the `tags`, I instantiate
a tag container that maps the read and write operations on the `tags` to the
`VariableReferences`. Here are some examples:

```cs
public partial class MyModule {
	static MyBusinessLogicTags myTags = new MyBusinessLogicTags(
		new VariableReference<string>(
			() => Globals.Tags.SomeTagName.Value,
			val => { Globals.Tags.SomeTagName.Value = val; }),
		new VariableReference<bool>(
			() => Globals.Tags.SomeOtherTagName.Value,
			val => { Globals.Tags.SomeOtherTagName.SetTag(); })
	);
}
```

This tag container is then passed as a parameter to the constructor of the
business logic module. 

#### Helper functions for testing

During testing, this helper class can be used to instantiate a tag container
that can be setup before each test case to simulate the desired state.

```cs
class Helpers {
	class TagContainer {
		public string someTagName;
		public bool someOtherTagName;

		public TagContainer() {
			someTagName = "";
			someOtherTagName = false;
		}
	}

	public static MyBusinessLogicTags CreateTags() {
		var tagContainer = new TagContainer();

		return new MyBusinessLogicTags(
			someTagName: new VariableReference<string>(
				() => tagContainer.someTagName,
				val => { tagContainer.someTagName = val; }),
			someOtherTagName: new VariableReference<string>(
				() => tagContainer.someOtherTagName,
				val => { tagContainer.someOtherTagName = val; })
		);
	}
}
```

### Limitations of Beijer iX over .NET CF

Even after setting the project up as described above, there are a few particularities
to avoid altogether or at least be aware of when opening iX Developer again.
Some of these will break the build in iX Developer, even though the project builds fine
in VS.

#### Auto properties

[Auto properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties)
in iX Developer only work as long as both `get` and `set` are specified.
In practice one might want to use just `{ get; }` to create a `readonly` property
but iX Developer won't compile that.

```cs
class Rectangle {
	public int A { get; set; }
	public int B { get; }
}
```

#### Named parameters

When using [named parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments),
iX Developer will complain about them but build the project just fine. ðŸ¤·

```cs
class Square: Rectangle {
	public Square(int a) : base(a = a, b = a) { }
}
```

#### Expression-bodied members

I noticed that iX Developer won't compile with
[expression-based members](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members#read-only-properties)
like this one:

```cs
class Rectangle {
	public int A;
	public int B;
	public int Area => A * B;
}
```
